Figure out how to gracefully build the documentation via cmake.
Requires pdflatex and the latex2man style files to build the pdf,
and the latex2man program to create the man file.  This may well
not exist on many systems.

Figure out how to install the petaca library, associated mod
files, documentations, etc.

Figure out how to build a distribution tarball using CPack(?)
